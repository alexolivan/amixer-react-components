A collection of React JS components to test feasibility of AmixerAPI.

Ther's a demo index page that will try to bind to AmixerAPI, get a list of
available Sound Controls, and tries to render the Controls.

Tested with Intel HDA sound card.

There's a Meter component, and a websocket connection to AmixerAPI, to simulate
Meter/vuMeter.
This being strictly sound card model dependant, is not fully implemented on
AmixerAPI.
